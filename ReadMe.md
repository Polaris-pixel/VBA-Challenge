## VBA script to analyze stock market data


Created a VBA script that will loop through all the stocks for each day of the year for three consecutive years in a single run. A summary table was created to display the following information:


*  **_Ticker symbol_** of each stock

* **_Yearly change_** in price of each stock from opening price at the beginning of a given year to closing price at the end of that year.

* **_Percent change_** in price of each stock every year based on the yearly change calculated.

*  **_Total stock volume_** of each stock for each year

* The script also returns the “**_Greatest % increase_**”, “**_Greatest % Decrease_**” and the “**_Highest Total Volume_**” of all the stocks for each year

* **_Conditional formatting_** has been applied to highlight positive yearly change in _green_ color and negative yearly change in _red_ color.
